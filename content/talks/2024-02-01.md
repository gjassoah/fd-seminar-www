Nakajima's quiver varieties are moduli spaces of quiver representations
which bear an additional symplectic structure. Out of such a symplectic
singularity, Namikawa constructs a "Namikawa-Weyl group" by means of
deformation theory, but implementing his construction in case of quiver
varieties remains open until today. In this talk, I recapitulate how
quiver varieties arise from representation theory, what is already known
about Namikawa-Weyl groups of other symplectic singularities, and how
Raf Bocklandt and I almost succeeded in the case of quiver varieties
during my 2018 master thesis. I will highlight some remaining technical
problems, which concern the difference between the algebraic and
analytic world and how to construct non-affine GIT quotients.
