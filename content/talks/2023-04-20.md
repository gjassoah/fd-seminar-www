Let \\(f\\) be a Hochschild \\(2\\)-cocycle and \\(A_f\\) an infinitesimal deformation
of a finite-dimensional associative \\(k\\)-algebra \\(A\\). We describe, under
some conditions on \\(f\\), the algebra structure of the Ext-algebra of \\(A_f\\)
in terms of the Ext-algebra of \\(A\\). We achieve this description by
getting an explicit construction of minimal projective resolutions.
This is based on joint work with L. Román and F. Rossi Bertone.
