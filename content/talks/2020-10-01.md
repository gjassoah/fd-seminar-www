\\(\tau\\)-tilting theory was introduced by Adachi, Iyama and Reiten as a far-reaching generalization of classical tilting theory for finite dimensional associative algebras. One of the main classes of objects in the theory is that of \\(\tau\\)-rigid modules: a module \\(M\\) over an algebra \\(\Lambda\\) is _\\(\tau\\)-rigid_ if \\(\operatorname{Hom}_{\Lambda}(M,\tau M)=0\\), where \\(\tau M\\) denotes the Auslander-Reiten translation of \\(M\\); such a module \\(M\\) is called \\(\tau\\)-tilting if the number \\(|M|\\) of non-isomorphic indecomposable summands of \\(M\\) equals the number of isomorphism classes of simple \\(\Lambda\\)-modules.  Recently, a new class of algebras was introduced by Demonet, Iyama, Jasso called _\\(\tau\\)-tilting finite_ algebras.  They are defined as finite dimensional algebras with only a finite number of isomorphism classes of basic \\(\tau\\)-tilting modules.
 
An obvious sufficient condition to be \\(\tau\\)-tilting finite is to be representation-finite.  In general, this condition is not necessary.  The aim of this talk is to show for algebras \\(\Lambda\\) such that \\(L_\Lambda\\) or \\(R_\Lambda\neq\emptyset\\) , representation-finiteness and \\(\tau\\)-tilting finiteness are equivalent conditions.
