This talk is based on joint work with Osamu Iyama.
Let \\(A\\) be a finite dimensional algebra over an algebraically closed field.
Brüstle-Smith-Treffinger introduced a wall-chamber structure on the real Grothendieck group \\(K_0(\operatorname{proj} A)_R\\) via stability conditions of King.
It is strongly related to TF equivalence, which is an equivalence relation on \\(K_0(\operatorname{proj} A)_R\\) defined by numerical torsion pairs of Baumann-Kamnitzer-Tingley.
Thanks to results by Yurikusa and Brüstle-Smith-Treffinger, I showed that the \\(g\\)-vector cone \\(C^+(U)\\) associated to each 2-term presilting complex $U$ in \\(K^b(\operatorname{proj} A)\\) is a TF equivalence class in my previous study, but we cannot obtain all TF equivalence classes in this way unless \\(A\\) is \\(\tau\\)-tilting finite.
In this joint work with Iyama, we obtained a generalization of this construction of TF equivalence classes by using canonical decompositions of elements in \\(K_0(\operatorname{proj} A)\\) introduced by Derksen-Fei in the case that \\(A\\) satisfies the condition called \\(E\\)-tameness.
I will talk about this result.
