We start out by reviewing some classical material on the representation 
theory of symmetric groups and the Hochschild cohomology of 
finite-dimensional algebras. We describe generating functions for the 
dimensions of the Hochschild cohomology of symmetric groups in each degree.
 
While it is known, using the classification of finite simple groups, that 
the first Hochschild cohomology of a non-semisimple finite group algebra is 
non-zero, it remains an open question whether this is true for non-simple 
blocks of finite groups. 

We use generating functions to show that the first  Hochschild cohomology 
of any non-simple block of a symmetric group algebra is non-zero. 
This is joint work with Dave Benson and Radha Kessar.
