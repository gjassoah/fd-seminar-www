We explain how to categorify various basic results from the representation theory of finite-dimensional algebras, which are useful for classifying simple modules, to the 2-representation theory of fiat 2-categories. We then apply these in order to obtain a classification of simple 2-representations of the 2-category of Soergel bimodules.
