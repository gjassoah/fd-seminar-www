 In this talk, I will provide a brief introduction to exact dg categories and then explore their application to various correspondences in representation theory. We will generalize the Auslander–Iyama correspondence, the Iyama–Solberg correspondence, and a correspondence considered in a paper by Iyama in 2005 to the setting of exact dg categories. The slogan is that solving correspondence-type problems becomes easier using dg categories, and interesting phenomena emerge when the dg category is concentrated in degree zero or is abelian.
