Alternating strand diagrams (as introduced by Postnikov) on the disk have been used in the study of the coordinate ring of the Grassmannian. In particular, they give rise to clusters of the Grassmannian cluster algebras (Scott) or to cluster-tilting objects of the Grassmannian cluster categories as defined by Jensen-King-Su (Baur-King-Marsh). On the other hand, orbifolds have also been related to cluster structures as Paquette-Schiffler (or Chekhov-Shapiro for a geometric approach). Here we introduce orbifold diagrams as quotients of symmetric Postnikov diagrams and show how to associate quivers with potentials to them. This is joint work with Andrea Pasquali (Stuttgart) and Diego Velasco (Cali).
