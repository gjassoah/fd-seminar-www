In this talk, I propose to study exact-categorical structures of torsion(-free)
classes of module categories. For functorially finite torsion-free class,
indecomposable projective and injective objects are easily described by
\\(\tau^-\\)-tilting modules, and in particular, the numbers of them coincide.
However, there can be more simple objects in torsion-free class, which I propose
to study. I explain that the number of simple objects controls the validity of
the Jordan--Hölder type theorem in a torsion-free class.

Then I'll talk about simple objects in a torsion-free class over the
preprojective algebra (and path algebra) of Dynkin type, which is also important
in Lie theory due to Geiss--Leclerc--Schröer's categorification of the cluster
structure. By Mizuno's result, we can associate an element \\(w\\) of the Weyl group
to each torsion-free class \\(\mathcal{F}\\). By (extended) Gabriel's theorem,
\\(\mathcal{F}\\) roughly corresponds to the inversion set of \\(w\\), the set of
positive roots which are sent to negative by  \\(w^{-1}\\). Then I show that simple
objects in \\(\mathcal{F}\\) are in bijection with Bruhat inversions of \\(w\\), which
are related to the Bruhat order of the Weyl group.
