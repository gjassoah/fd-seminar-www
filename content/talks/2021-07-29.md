If \\(k\\) is a field, \\(A\\) a finite dimensional \\(k\\)-algebra, then the simple \\(A\\)-modules form a simple minded collection in the derived category \\(\\operatorname{D}^\\mathrm{b}(\operatorname{mod}A)\\). Their extension closure is \\(\\operatorname{mod}A\\); in particular, it is abelian. This situation is emulated by a general simple minded collection \\(S\\) in a suitable triangulated category \\(\\mathcal{C}\\). In particular, the extension closure \\(\\langle S\\rangle\\) is abelian, and there is a tilting theory for such abelian subcategories of \\(\\mathcal{C}\\). These statements follow from \\(\\langle S\\rangle\\) being the heart of a bounded \\(t\\)-structure.

It is a defining characteristic of simple minded collections that their negative self extensions vanish in every degree. Relaxing this to vanishing in degrees \\(\\{-w+1,...,-1\\}\\) where \\(w\\) is a positive integer leads to the rich, parallel notion of \\(w\\)-simple minded systems, which have recently been the subject of vigorous interest within negative cluster tilting theory.

If \\(S\\) is a \\(w\\)-simple minded system for some \\(w\\geq2\\), then \\(\\langle S\\rangle\\) is typically not the heart of a \\(t\\)-structure. However, it is possible to prove by different means that \\(\\langle S\\rangle\\) is still abelian and that there is a tilting theory for such abelian subcategories. We will explain the theory behind this, which is based on Quillen's notion of exact categories.
