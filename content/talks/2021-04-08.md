A rank function is a nonnegative real-valued, additive, translation-invariant function on the objects of a triangulated category satisfying the triangle inequality on distinguished triangles. I will present motivation for and examples of rank functions on derived and stable categories of finite dimensional algebras. This is joint work with Andrey Lazarev.
