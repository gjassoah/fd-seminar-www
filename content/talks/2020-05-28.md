Given an acyclic quiver Q and an integer \\(w\\), the orbit category 
\\[ C_w(Q) = \mathcal{D}^b(\mathbf{k} Q)/\Sigma^{-w} \mathbb{S} \\] 
is a \\(w\\)-Calabi-Yau triangulated category, where \\(\Sigma\\) is the shift 
functor on \\(\mathcal{D}^b(\mathbf{k} Q)\\) and \\(\mathbb{S}\\) is the Serre 
functor. When \\(w \geq 2\\), these orbit categories are called (higher) 
cluster categories and the key generators are (higher) cluster-tilting 
objects; they are in bijection with silting objects in the fundamental 
domain. Amongst other connections, the combinatorics of (higher) 
cluster-tilting objects serve as a categorical model of those of 
(higher) noncrossing partitions.

Simple-minded systems were introduced by Koenig-Liu as an abstraction of 
nonprojective simple modules in stable module categories. In this talk, 
we will see that simple-minded systems in \\(C_w(Q)\\) for \\(w \leq -1\\) are 
in bijection with simple-minded collections in the fundamental domain. 
We will show further that they are in bijection with positive (higher) 
noncrossing partitions in the Weyl group of Q. This provides further 
evidence supporting the view that \\(C_w(Q)\\) for \\(w \leq -1\\) are negative 
cluster categories in which simple-minded systems play the role of 
cluster-tilting objects, providing categorical models of combinatorial 
objects, such as positive (higher) noncrossing partitions.

This talk is based on joint work with Raquel Coelho Simoes and David 
Ploog.
