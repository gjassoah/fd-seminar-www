Tilting modules have played an important role in representation theory
of algebras. Especially, infinitely generated tilting modules provide 
completely different features. In this case, recollements of triangulated 
categories in the sense of Beilinson-Bernstein-Deligne enter into the 
play. In this talk, we introduce symmetric subcategories and show that, 
for any good tilting module over an algebra, the derived category of the 
endomorphism algebra of the tilting module is always a recollement of 
the derived categories of the given algebra and a symmetric subcategory 
of a module category. Explicit examples of symmetric subcategories 
associated to 2-good tilting modules over commutative Gorenstein rings 
are presented. This talk reports a joint work with Hongxing Chen.
