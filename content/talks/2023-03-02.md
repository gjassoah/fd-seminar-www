Pre-Calabi-Yau structures are noncommutative versions of Poisson structures appearing in homological mirror symmetry, and can be used to describe certain types of TQFT operations on Hochschild homology. In this talk, I will recall the definitions and applications of these structures, and then describe how to use these structures to give a certain algebraic model for the string topology of non-simply connected manifolds. This talk is based on a current joint project with Manuel Rivera and Zhengfang Wang.
