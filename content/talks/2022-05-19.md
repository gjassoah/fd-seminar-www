Dimension expanders, introduced by Wigderson and Lubotzky-Zelmanov, are a linear algebra analogue of the notion of expander graphs. We interpret this notion in terms of quiver representations, as a quantitative variant of stabilty. We use Schofield’s recursive description of general subrepresentations to re-derive existence of dimension expanders and to determine optimal expansion coefficients.
