In this talk we combine the construction of important algebras in geometric representation theory under one theme and give them a motivic description which we call motivic Springer theory. Motives form an interesting triangulated category with a nice weight structureÂ  given by Chow motives. We recall the notion of weight structures and weight complex functors and provide several natural occurrences of them related to tilting theory.
