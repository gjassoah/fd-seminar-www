In this talk, I’ll describe our work towards providing an infinite rank version of the Grassmanian cluster categories introduced by Jensen, King and Su. We develop a new combinatorial tool for determining when two k-subsets of the integers are “non-crossing”, or equivalently when two Plücker coordinates of a Grassmanian cluster algebra of infinite rank are “compatible”. We use this tool to show that there is a structure preserving bijection between these Plücker coordinates and the generically free modules of rank 1 in our Grassmanian category of infinite rank, mirroring a result of Jensen, King and Su in the finite case. This is joint work with Man-Wai Cheung, Eleonore Faber, Sira Gratz and Sibylle Schroll.
