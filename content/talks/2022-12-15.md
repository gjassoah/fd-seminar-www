The aim of this talk is to report on some recent
progress related to the classical problem of
description of extensions of Verma modules in
BGG category O. In particular, looking at the
refined picture provided by graded extensions
and using some classical results of Delorme, we
determine the role the R-polynomials play in
this theory. Consequently, we determine many
cases in which  extensions can be described by
the Gabber-Joseph formula and construct explicit
examples where this formula fails.

Based on a joint work with Hankyung Ko.
