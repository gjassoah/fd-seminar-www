I will introduce a notion of “multi-scale stability conditions” that, under some finiteness assumptions, generalise the notion of Bridgeland stability for a triangulated category. For Ginzburg categories of type A_n, multi-scale stability conditions can be used to construct a smooth compactification of an appropriate quotient of the usual stability manifold. Based on joint work with M.Moeller and J.So.
