The Bridgeland stability space of a triangulated category is a non-compact complex manifold with a wall-and-chamber structure capturing interesting aspects of the category’s structure.

I will describe joint work with Broomhead, Pauksztello and Ploog in which we partially compactify the stability space by allowing `degenerate’ stability conditions with massless objects.

One reason this is interesting is that the added boundary points are closely related to the walls. I will illustrate this connection in low-dimensional examples arising from quivers with two vertices.
