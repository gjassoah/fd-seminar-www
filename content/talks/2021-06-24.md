 We start with an introduction to singularity categories and equivalences between them. In particular, we recall known results about singular equivalences between commutative rings, which go back to Kn√∂rrer, Yang, Kawamata and a joint work with Karmazyn. Then we explain a new singular equivalence between an affine surface and an affine threefold. This seems to be the first (non-trivial) example of a singular equivalence involving rings of even and odd Krull dimension.
