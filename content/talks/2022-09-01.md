The representation theory of an algebra gives rise to various
interesting geometrical objects, such as the g-vector fan and Newton
polytopes of representations. Classical objects such as the associahedron
can be realized in this way, and these constructions have interesting
applications in the categorification of cluster algebras.

In this talk, I will associate to any representation-finite algebra
another geometrical object, an affine variety which is closely related to
the polytopes mentioned above. We will see how this variety reflects the
tau-tilting theory of the algebra, and how F-polynomials of
representations give a parametrization of it.

This is a report on ongoing work with Nima Arkani-Hamed, Hadleigh Frost,
Giulio Salvatori and Hugh Thomas.
