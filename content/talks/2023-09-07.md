Derived categories have come to play a decisive role in a wide range of topics. Several
recent developments, in particular in the context of topological Fukaya categories, arouse the
desire to study not just single categories, but rather complexes of categories. In this talk, we
will discuss examples of such complexes in algebra, topology, algebraic geometry, and symplectic
geometry, along with some results and conjectures involving them.

Based on joint work with Merlin Christ and Tashi Walde.
