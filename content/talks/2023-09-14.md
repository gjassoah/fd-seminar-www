In this talk, we define skew-Brauer graph algebras, a generalization of the well-known Brauer graph algebras.

We show that in the same way, a Brauer graph algebras is defined from a graph with extra data on each vertex and the edges attached to it, a skew-Brauer graph algebra is also defined from a graph with some extra data that captures an $\mathbb{Z}_2$-action on gentle algebras. We  also show that the trivial extension of any skew-gentle algebra is a skew-Brauer graph algebra. Finally, we present a geometric interpretation of the notion of admissible cuts of a trivial extension of skew-gentle algebras using dissections of orbifild surfaces.
