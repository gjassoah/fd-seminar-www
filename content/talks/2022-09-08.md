We prove irreducible components of moduli spaces of semistable representations of clannish algebras are isomorphic to products of projective spaces. This is achieved by showing irreducible components of varieties of representations of clannish algebras can be viewed as irreducible components of skewed-gentle algebras, which we show are always normal. The main theorem generalizes an analogous result for moduli of representations of special biserial algebras proven by Carroll-Chindris-Kinser-Weyman.
