We introduce the notion of a symmetric quiver as provided by Derksen and Weyman in 2002 and discuss symmetric degenerations in this context (which correspond to orbit closure relations in the symmetric representation variety). After motivating our particular interest in the latter by presenting connections to group actions in algebraic Lie Theory, we explain our main questions: are symmetric degenerations induced by "usual" degenerations in the representation variety of the underlying quiver? We look at (counter)examples and recent results.

This is joint work with G. Cerulli Irelli and F. Esposito.
