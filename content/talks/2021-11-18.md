The computation of lattices of thick subcategories has emerged as a popular topic and serves as a more achievable analogue of classifying objects. Often one understands such lattices by describing them in terms of some associated topological space. However, in many representation theoretic examples this is not possible. Iâ€™ll explain what the obstruction is and mention work in progress aimed at addressing this issue.

This talk is based on joint work with Greg Stevenson.
