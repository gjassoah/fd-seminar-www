I will speak about some geometric aspects of the representation theory of
gentle algebras. Some results regarding the irreducible components of the
affine schemes of modules over gentle algebras will be presented. In the
case of gentle algebras arising from triangulations of unpunctured
surfaces, a bijection between the set of laminations on the surface and the
set of generically tau-reduced irreducible components (formerly called
"strongly reduced" by Geiss-Leclerc-Schröer) will be described. The talk is
based on joint work with Christof Geiss and Jan Schröer.
