Opper, Plamondon and Schroll described a geometric model for the derived category of gentle algebras. In this talk I will explain how to use this model to get one for the derived category of skew-gentle algebras. The main tool is the use of the skew-group algebra structure of the skew-gentle algebras. This is a collaboration with Thomas Brüstle.
