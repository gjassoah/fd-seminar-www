String algebras are monomial algebras introduced by Butler and Ringel, where they showed any indecomposable representation is: a string module, given by a relation-avoiding walk in the quiver; or a band module, given by a cyclic walk and some module over the Laurent polynomial ring. Clannish algebras, introduced by Crawley-Boevey, generalise string algebras - in addition to monomial relations, one specifies a set of special loops, each bounded by some monic quadratic polynomial. Butler and Ringelâ€™s classification was then adapted, where the class of string (or band) modules splits into asymmetric and symmetric subclasses. Said symmetry is a reflection of the walk about a special loop, and symmetric strings and bands are parameterised by replacements for the Laurent polynomial ring.

Both string algebras and clannish algebras are defined over a field, and the quadratics bounding special loops must factor with distinct roots in this field. This talk is based on joint work with Crawley-Boevey (2204.12138), where we generalise the module classification for clannish algebras. We replace the ground field with a division ring, we equip each arrow with an automorphism of this division ring, and we allow irreducible quadratics to bound the special loops. The resulting notion of a semilinear clannish algebra specifies to a generalisation of string algebras considered by Ringel, where the map associated to an arrow in any representation must be semilinear with respect to its automorphism.
