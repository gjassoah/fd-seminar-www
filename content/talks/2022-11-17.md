It is not necessarily the case that a dg algebra with finite dimensional cohomology is quasi-isomorphic to one which is honestly finite dimensional, i.e. a finite dimensional algebra with a compatible differential. However, provided the cohomology is concentrated in non-positive degrees one can always find such a quasi-isomorphism. Such finite dimensional dg algebras have many amusing properties, and I will explain some of them.
