Given a finite dimensional algebra \\(A\\) over an algebraically closed field \\(k\\), Han's conjecture relates two homological invariants associated to \\(A\\):
its global dimension and its Hochschild homology. In the commutative case -- non necessarily finite dimensional but finitely generated -- the finiteness of the global dimension is equivalent to the fact that \\(A\\) is geometrically regular.
More precisely, Han's conjecture states that for \\(A\\) finite dimensional, \\(A\\) is smooth if and only if \\(HH_n(A)=0\\) for \\(n\gg0\\). The direct implication known to be is true.

We proved in [1] that the class \\(\mathcal{H}\\) of finite dimensional algebras  which verify Han's conjecture is closed under split bounded extensions. More precisely if \\(A=B\oplus M\\) is such an extension, then \\(A\in\mathcal{H}\\) if and only if \\(B\in\mathcal{H}\\). The proofs make use of the Jacobi--Zariski long exact sequence, and of the reduced relative bar resolution. 

I will explain this result and a generalization for algebras that are non necessarily split.
As a consequence of our work, we prove that in some cases, adding or deleting arrows to a quiver -- even adding or deleting certain relations --
does not change the situation with respect to Han's conjecture. 

This talk contains joint work with Claude Cibils, Marcelo Lanzilotta and Eduardo Marcos.
