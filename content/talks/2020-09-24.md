I will first recall the relation between Leavitt path algebras and the singularity categories of
radical-square-zero algebras.  Using Leavitt path algebras, we confirm  Keller's conjecrure for any radical-square-zero algebra:
 there is an isomorphism in the homotopy category of $B_\infty$-algebras between the Hochschild cochain complex of the
dg singularity category and the singular Hochschild cochain complex of the algebra. Moreover, we prove that Keller's conjecture
is invariant under one-point (co)extensions and singular equivalences with levels. This is joint with Huanhuan Li and Zhengfang Wang.
