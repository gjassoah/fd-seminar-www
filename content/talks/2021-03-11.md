There is a natural action of a torus on a given moduli space of a
quiver. Weist shows that the components of the fixed point locus of this action
are again quiver moduli; more precisely moduli spaces for a covering quiver. The
induced torus action on the tangent space of a fixed point induces a weight
space decomposition. We show that the weight spaces can be identified with Ext
groups of representations of the covering quiver. For actions of tori of rank
one, we give an explicit description of attracting sets of fixed point
components. The talk is based on joint work with M. Boos.
