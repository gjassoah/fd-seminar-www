In 2005, Balmer introduced the notion of a prime thick tensor
ideal for a tensor triangulated category T as an analogous concept to
a prime ideal of a commutative ring. Using prime thick tensor ideals,
Balmer established the epoch-making theory so-called the
tensor-triangular geometry which allows us to study T by
commutative-algebraic/algebro-geometric approaches.
On the other hand, recently I have introduced the notion of prime
thick subcategories to develop a similar theory to the
tensor-triangular geometry for tensor triangulated categories without
tensor structures. In this talk, we study prime thick subcategories of
the perfect derived category D^perf(X), the bounded derived category
D^b(X), and the singularity category D^sg(X) of a noetherian scheme X.
Especially, we give a characterization of a point x of X to be a
complete intersection or a hypersurface in terms of prime thick
subcategories of such derived categories.
