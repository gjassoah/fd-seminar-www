Motivated by work of Cohn and Schofield on Sylvester rank functions,
Chuang and Lazarev have recently introduced the notion of a rank
function on a triangulated category. They show that Verdier quotients
into simple triangulated categories are classified by a certain type of
rank functions, and that such rank functions on the perfect derived
category of a dg algebra describe derived localisations into dg
skew-fields. In this talk, we suggest interpreting rank functions as
certain additive functions on the functor category. As a consequence, we
obtain that every integral rank function decomposes uniquely as a sum of
irreducible ones. In the following, we focus on compactly generated
triangulated categories, where basic rank functions on the compacts are
length functions with respect to certain endofinite objects. We show
that rank functions in this context are closely related to definable
subcategories and smashing localisations, which allows us to extend the
aforementioned results by Chuang and Lazarev. This talk is based on
joint work with Teresa Conde, Mikhail Gorsky and Alexandra Zvonareva.
