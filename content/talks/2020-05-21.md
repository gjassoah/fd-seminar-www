A Postnikov diagram is a collection of strands in the disk, satisfying
combinatorial conditions on their crossings. The diagram determines many other
mathematical objects, including a cluster algebra, which Galashin and Lam have
recently shown to be isomorphic to the homogeneous coordinate ring of a certain
subvariety of the Grassmannian, called a  positroid variety. In this talk, I
will explain how to categorify this cluster algebra, using a second
(non-commutative) algebra attached to the Postnikov diagram. The approach
depends on studying Calabi–Yau symmetries of this algebra, and relates to work
of Broomhead and others concerning dimer models on closed surfaces.
