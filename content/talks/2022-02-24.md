In many tensor triangulated categories the thick
subcategories of the compact objects and the localizing subcategories
of the whole category are classified by topological spaces with the
same underlying set. Examples include the derived category of a
commutative noetherian ring and the stable module category of a finite
group. A well-generated triangulated category is generated by a set of
\alpha-compact objects for some regular cardinal \alpha. Under some
mild conditions the \alpha-localizing subcategories of \alpha-
compact objects are also classified by a topological space. In my talk
I explain the connection between the topological spaces classifying the
thick subcategories of the compact objects, the \alpha-localizing
subcategories of the \alpha-compact objects, and the localizing
subcategories. This is joint work with Henning Krause.
