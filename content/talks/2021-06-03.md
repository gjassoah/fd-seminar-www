(Joint work with Kiyoshi Igusa and Job D. Rock) I will discuss continuous cluster categories, generalizations of those, cluster
structures, examples when only conditions for “cluster theories”, but not “cluster structures” (in the sense of BIRS) are satisfied. Also relations between
various cluster theories will be stated (some known, some naturally expected).
