n-cluster tilting subcategories play a central role in higher dimensional Auslander–Reiten theory. The main aim of this talk is to present a classification of n-cluster tilting subcategories for truncated path algebras, that is, bound quiver algebras of the form KQ/J^L where Q is a quiver and J is the ideal generated by the arrows of Q. Some further properties of these algebras will be described. If time permits, a classification of nℤ-cluster tilting subcategories for truncated path algebras will also be presented. This talk is based on joint work in progress with Steffen Oppermann.
