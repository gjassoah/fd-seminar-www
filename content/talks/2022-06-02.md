We introduce dominant Auslander regular algebras and minimal Auslander-Cohen-Macaulay algebras as a generalisation of higher Auslander algebras. As an application we show how those two new classes of algebras can be used to answer a question by Green and another question by Auslander and Reiten. This is joint work in progress with Aaron Chan and Osamu Iyama.
