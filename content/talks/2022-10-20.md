Let \\(k\\) be an algebraically closed field and \\(A\\) a finite dimensional k-algebra. The universal localization of \\(A\\) with respect to a set of morphisms between finitely generated projective \\(A\\)-modules always exists. When \\(A\\) is hereditary, Krause and Stovicek proved that the universal localizations of \\(A\\) are in bijection with various natural structures.

In this talk I will introduce the higher analogue of universal localizations, that is universal localizations of \\(d\\)-homological pairs with respect to certain wide subcategories, and show a (partial) generalisation of Krause and Stovicek result in the higher setup.
