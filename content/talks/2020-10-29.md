The talk will focus on finite-dimensional DG algebras and categories of perfect complexes over such DG algebras. These categories can be considered as proper derived noncommutative schemes. We are going to discuss basic properties of these noncommutative schemes and to establish a connection between such categories and DG categories with (semi)exceptional collections.
